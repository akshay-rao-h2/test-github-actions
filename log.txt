The code changes are fine. No issues found.
Code review feedback:
- There is redundancy between the naming of AITOKEN and aiToken, which may cause confusion.

- Use meaningful variable names instead of 'tokens' and 'chatToken'.
- The use of '+' before the variables is unnecessary and may result in unexpected results.
- Consider using a default value for 'chatToken' if none of the AITOKEN, AiToken, aitoken and aiToken values are present.
- Security concern: GitHub token is hardcoded in the code. Use secrets instead.
No issues found in this code change, continue reviewing the rest of the patches.
- Remove console.log statements and commented out code before merging.
- The commented out code should be removed for better code clarity.
- The commented out code should be removed or explained why it's commented out.
- Good job! Functional code with appropriate use of async/await for API calls. No bugs found.
- Can't provide feedback as code changes are not visible in the patch. Please provide the diffs for review.
- Remove unused variable PRReviewResult
- The code block seems to be incomplete, please make sure there is no missing code.
Feedback:
- There seems to be missing closing brackets for some function calls, leading to syntax errors.
Potential bug: In the added code for test.js, the variable "test" is only initialized with the string "name:", but it's never used.
No feedback is needed as there are no code changes in this patch.
